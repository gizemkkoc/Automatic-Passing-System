Automatic Passing System

This project is designed to simulate the road crossing status of different types of vehicles using the automatic passing system (OGS). 
The program calculates a toll determined by each vehicle type and checks the transit status.  
I tried to use inheritance, polymorphism and OOP states in the program.
